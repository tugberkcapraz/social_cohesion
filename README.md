# SOCIAL COHESION TERM PAPER
This repository contains code and term paper for class Social Cohesion offered in 2020-2021 Winter Semester. 

I tried to model perceptions of change in social cohesion during the pandemic using MRP. 

I used BRMS package for the model fitting. When I have time and more expertise, I will re-evaluate this project using raw stan.
